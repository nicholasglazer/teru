# Changelog

## 0.8.3 (2026-06-02)

### Added

- **Nested teru is now controllable via a `Ctrl+A` prefix.** Previously a
  teru-inside-teru couldn't be driven at all: the outer teru grabs both Alt and
  its `Ctrl+B` prefix first, so nothing reached the inner. In nested mode
  (`TERU_NESTED=1` / `TERM_PROGRAM=teru`) the inner now uses **Ctrl+A** as its
  prefix — which the outer does *not* grab and therefore forwards through — so
  `Ctrl+A j` / `Ctrl+A k` (focus), `Ctrl+A 1/2/3` (workspace), etc. drive the
  remote session while `Ctrl+B` and Alt stay with your local teru. Pairs with
  the 0.8.2 nested status-bar drop for a clean single-bar, fully-drivable nested
  session.

## 0.8.2 (2026-06-02)

### Added

- **Nested mode** (`TERU_NESTED=1`). When teru runs inside another teru — e.g.
  a local teru → ssh → remote `teru -n agents` — the inner one now **drops its
  own status bar and gives that row back to the panes**, so you don't get two
  overlapping `1 2 3 grid` bars and no blank gap is left behind. Auto-detected
  via `TERM_PROGRAM=teru` (set in a local teru pane) and, because that env var
  isn't forwarded over SSH, also via an explicit `TERU_NESTED=1` you set on the
  remote: `TERU_NESTED=1 teru -n agents`. Note: the **outer** teru still owns
  Alt + the Ctrl+B prefix (it grabs them first), so the inner session can't be
  driven by those keys while nested — that's inherent to nesting the same
  multiplexer; run the SSH session in a non-teru terminal if you want Alt to
  reach the remote directly.

## 0.8.1 (2026-06-02)

Hotfix for the SSH render dropout reported against 0.8.0.

### Fixes (high)

- **Panes didn't all draw on attach over SSH; bottom panes stayed blank until
  clicked, and keybinds like Alt+J/K appeared to do nothing.** Root cause: the
  client's render flush (`TuiScreen.writeAllFd`) treated `EAGAIN` as "stop" and
  silently dropped the rest of the frame. Over SSH, stdin/stdout/stderr share
  one open file description, so the `O_NONBLOCK` set on stdin (needed to poll it)
  also makes stdout non-blocking — under SSH backpressure the flush hit EAGAIN
  and dropped the tail of the screen (the bottom panes). Because `flush()` then
  updates the diff baseline `prev[]` to the full frame, the dropped cells were
  never re-emitted, so they stayed blank until something changed them (a click's
  active-border, a workspace switch). This also made focus changes (Alt+J/K)
  look like no-ops — the focus moved on the daemon but the confirming re-render
  was dropped. `writeAllFd` now resumes across EAGAIN/EINTR via `POLL.OUT`
  (mirrors the 0.8.0 daemon-side `writeAll` fix), so each frame is delivered
  intact. (Same class of bug, both sides of the wire now hardened.)

## 0.8.0 (2026-06-02)

Remote-attach multiplexer correctness overhaul. A full review (47 findings, 34
confirmed) plus a live PTY reproduction rig found that the interactive
`teru -n NAME` experience was broken in several core ways. Every fix below was
**reproduced** on a real attached client and **re-verified** after the change
(routing matrix, layout, content replay). All 527 inline tests pass.

### Fixes (critical)

- **Clicking a pane focused the WRONG pane; typed input landed in a different
  pane than the one highlighted (S1/S2).** Two root causes: (1) the daemon
  serialized `active_node` in state_sync, which is always null for flat layouts
  (master-stack/grid/monocle, where focus lives in `active_index`), so the
  daemon's real focus never reached the client — now it ships
  `getActiveNodeId()`; (2) the mouse handler walked `focus_next/prev` a relative
  number of steps from a stale local index (which *wrapped* to a neighbour) —
  replaced with an absolute `focus_pane` command carrying the target pane id.
  The client now resolves the daemon's focus into `active_index` centrally in
  `parseDaemonStateSync`, covering attach, steady-state, and poll paths.
  Reproduced: click→pane matrix was fully scrambled; now diagonal on both grid
  and master-stack.
- **`closePane` use-after-free could crash the whole daemon.** `orderedRemove`
  memmoves the remaining `Pane` structs but never re-linked their
  `vt.grid`/`vt.response_ctx`/`grid.scrollback` self-pointers — the next
  `vt.feed()` wrote through a freed `*Grid`. Now re-links all survivors (the same
  invariant the spawn paths uphold).

### Fixes (high)

- **A template `layout = grid` rendered as `master-stack` (S3).**
  `Workspace.addNode` re-ran `autoSelectLayout()` on every pane spawn,
  overwriting the declared layout (autoSelect returns master-stack for 2–4
  panes). Added a `layout_pinned` flag set by template restore and state_sync,
  gating the three autoSelect sites; cleared by an explicit layout-cycle.
  Verified: status bar now shows `grid` with a real 2×2 layout.
- **Reattach showed blank panes; existing screen content was lost.** The client
  called `pane.grid.clearScreen(2)` on every pane immediately *after* the
  attach-time grid replay — erasing exactly what it had just replayed. Removed;
  the non-destructive `resize` preserves the replayed content. Verified: all
  pane banners now survive attach.
- **Garble/corruption under SSH load.** `writeAll` treated `EAGAIN` as fatal and
  aborted mid-frame, permanently desyncing the wire (header sent, payload
  dropped → the peer reframed every following byte). Now resumes across
  EAGAIN/EINTR via `POLL.OUT` so each frame is delivered as a unit, with a
  bounded wait so a dead peer can't wedge the daemon.
- **Alt+H / Alt+L leaked into the focused pane as `ESC+h` / `ESC+l`**, which
  readline/Claude read as Meta-h (kill-word) / Meta-l (downcase) — silently
  mutilating typed input. Added `resize_shrink`/`resize_grow` wire commands and
  mapped the keys. Verified: no ESC leak; the master pane resizes.
- **Daemon reflows a pane's Grid (not just the PTY) on per-pane resize**, so a
  non-active workspace's pane no longer keeps its 24×80 spawn default and replay
  at the wrong geometry.

### Known remaining (tracked for the next pass)

- A non-active workspace's *pre-attach* content does not yet replay on switch
  (new output after switching renders fine; switching + focus + input routing
  all work). Tied to grid-sync coverage / a full state reconcile.
- Render perf: the grid-sync is still plaintext/lossy and steady-state output is
  relayed without a damage/delta protocol. The EAGAIN fix removes the
  corruption; a diffed render + delta protocol is a separately-scoped follow-up.
- Docs (`KEYBINDINGS.md` TUI/remote section), state_sync buffer enlargement,
  CSI-timeout de-wedge, ghost-pane pruning, and a centralized append+relink
  helper remain from the review backlog.

## 0.7.2 (2026-06-01)

Hotfix on top of 0.7.1: attaching a session and moving the mouse flooded the
terminal with VT-parser trace lines (`feed: 12 bytes: 1b 5b 3c …`,
`CSI final=0x6d params_len=9 …`, `SGR mouse detected!`), visibly corrupting the
TUI.

### Fixes (high)

- **Input-trace debug output leaked into the attached terminal.**
  `TuiInput.debugLog` wrote unconditionally to the client's stderr — which *is*
  the user's terminal — on every byte fed, every CSI dispatch, and every mouse
  event. With SGR mouse mode enabled the terminal streams a motion sequence per
  mouse move, so the screen filled with hex dumps interleaved with the real
  render. The recent `std.debug.print → TERU_LOG`-gated migration missed it
  because it used a private helper, not `std.debug.print`. The helper is now
  gated behind `TERU_LOG=debug` (off by default, a no-op after one cached env
  read on the hot input path; set `TERU_LOG=debug` + redirect `2>` to recover
  the trace). Verified end-to-end: injecting SGR mouse motion into an attached
  client now produces zero trace lines (and exactly the expected lines with
  `TERU_LOG=debug`).

## 0.7.1 (2026-06-01)

Makes persistent sessions actually usable as a tmux replacement for the
remote-agent workflow (ssh in, run agents, close the laptop, reconnect later).
Four defects — two fatal — are fixed, each first reproduced against the real
symptom (three with new end-to-end tests — `tests/session_survival_e2e.py`,
`tests/daemon_resize_stress.py`, `tests/many_pane_e2e.py` — and the multi-pane
attach crash live on the deploy server, then locked down with an inline
regression test). Full write-up in
[`AUDIT-2026-06-01-daemon.md`](AUDIT-2026-06-01-daemon.md); new user guide
[`docs/SESSIONS.md`](docs/SESSIONS.md). All 527 inline tests pass.

### Fixes (critical)

- **Attaching a multi-pane session segfaulted the client.** `teru -n NAME` on
  any session with ≥2 panes crashed with a raw `SIGSEGV` in `VtParser.feed`
  during the state-sync replay. `parseDaemonStateSync` appended each remote pane
  to the multiplexer's `ArrayList` but re-linked only the just-added pane's
  `vt.grid`/`vt.response_ctx` self-pointers; a reallocating append moved every
  earlier `Pane`, leaving their parser pointing at freed memory. Single-pane
  sessions never reallocate, so they attached fine — which hid the bug until a
  9-pane layout was attached on the server. Now re-links **all** panes after each
  append, matching the invariant `Multiplexer.addPane` already upheld. Guarded by
  `modes/common.zig`'s `parseDaemonStateSync: multi-pane attach re-links every
  pane's vt.grid` test.
- **Session daemon died on SSH disconnect / laptop close** — exactly "I close my
  laptop and the agents stop." `teru -n NAME` forked the daemon with no
  `setsid()`, so it stayed in the ssh login session's process group with the PTY
  as controlling terminal; the hangup SIGHUP on disconnect killed the daemon and
  every agent it owned. The forked daemon now `setsid()`s into its own session
  before exec and re-points std{in,out,err} off the dying PTY onto a per-session
  log file (`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/teru-session-<name>.log`). Verified end-to-end:
  daemon + agents survive disconnect, reconnect reattaches to the same daemon and
  replays state.

### Fixes (high)

- **A client could crash the daemon with `resize(0,0)`.** A 0-dimension resize
  drove pane grids to 0 columns; the next byte of PTY output indexed an empty
  cell slice and panicked `VtParser`, taking the daemon (and all agents) down.
  The daemon now ignores 0-dimension resizes; `VtParser.feed` and the TUI
  renderer guard 0-size grids/screens (`w -| 1`), and the client clamps a 0
  winsize to 24×80 at the source.
- **Large sessions silently dropped panes.** The daemon's poll set was a fixed
  `[36]` array that stopped at ~32 PTYs with a client attached, so panes past the
  cap (e.g. in the 34-pane `claude-power` layout) were never drained and their
  agents blocked. The poll set is now a heap buffer grown to the live pane count.

### Docs

- New [`docs/SESSIONS.md`](docs/SESSIONS.md): the persistent-session / tmux-
  replacement workflow, `.tsess` predefined layouts, detach/reattach, diagnostics.
- [`docs/DEBUGGING.md`](docs/DEBUGGING.md): per-session daemon log file.
- New `examples/agents.tsess`: a safe 3-workspace / 9-pane starter layout
  (2×2 agent grids + scratch shell, all `auto_start = false`) for the
  remote-agent session.

### Build

- **Zig 0.17.0-dev.639 compatibility.** The toolchain rolled dev.420 → dev.639,
  which removed `std.Build.args`; `build.zig` now forwards `zig build run --`
  arguments via `Run.addPassthruArgs()` at the three run sites. (The dev.420
  upstream `std/os/linux.zig:8552` termios typo from 0.7.0's note is still
  present in dev.639 — same one-line `arch_bits` → `native_arch` patch, or build
  with a fixed Zig.)

## 0.7.0 (2026-05-31)

A large hardening release triggered by a Zig toolchain bump to
`0.17.0-dev.420`. A full line-by-line re-audit of both binaries (and a
second pass cross-referencing every std API against the real dev.420
stdlib source) fixed **6 critical + 22 high** findings plus ~22 mediums,
modernised the code for dev.420, and added 9 regression tests. Builds
clean and all 542 tests + the headless teruwm E2E pass on dev.420.

> Note: `zig-master-bin 0.17.0-dev.420` ships an upstream stdlib typo
> (`std/os/linux.zig:8552`, `arch_bits` should be `native_arch`) that
> breaks the build of any termios user on x86_64. teru's own source needs
> no changes; build with a fixed Zig or the documented one-line patch.

### Security

- **In-band MCP cross-pane exfiltration closed.** An agent using the
  OSC-9999 in-band channel could forge a second `pane_id` via JSON-key
  injection (`x":50,"pane_id`) and read another pane's scrollback (sudo
  prompts, SSH sessions). The forced `pane_id` is now emitted first and
  caller-supplied ones dropped, and non-identifier arg keys are rejected.

### Fixes (critical)

- **Font-atlas heap overflow on the default build.** The zoom/variant
  rasterizers hardcoded a 959-glyph count and a divergent range order, so
  setting `font_bold`/`font_italic` on the default `-Dglyphs=extended`
  build overflowed the variant atlas (and a font zoom rendered wrong
  glyphs). All four paths now share one budget-aware codepoint builder.
- **Heap use-after-free in the process graph.** `ProcessGraph.spawn`
  stored borrowed name/agent strings; callers pass transient buffers. The
  graph now owns (dupes/frees) its strings.
- **OOB on hidden scratchpads.** `closeNode` / `moveNodeToWorkspace`
  indexed the `[10]Workspace` array with `HIDDEN_WS` (255) for a parked
  scratchpad — reachable via MCP. Both guarded.
- **Scroll-overlay underflow panic** on a common smooth-scroll boundary.

### Fixes (high)

- **Standalone teru / daemon / dead-display 100%-CPU spins.** A shell
  exiting on its own left a hung-up PTY poll-ready forever; a dead X /
  Wayland display did the same. Reaping sweeps + connection-error
  detection fix all three (the standalone analogs of the v0.6.10
  compositor blocker).
- **Agent / MCP / `.tsess` commands now actually run.** `spawnPaneWithCommand`
  execve'd the whole command string as a literal path; multi-word commands
  silently ENOENT'd. Now run via `/bin/sh -c` (and honour `spawn_config`).
- **Untrusted MCP input no longer panics** (workspace/int range guards),
  **`teru_wait_for` no longer blocks the event loop** 500 ms, **URL-open
  no longer leaks a zombie** per click, **PaneBackend context slots are
  reaped**, hot-restart **no longer leaks panes/PTY fds**, fullscreen-exit
  restores floating windows, restored panes register in `pane_index`,
  layout ratios are clamped (corrupt `.tsess`), the daemon↔client wire no
  longer desyncs on a partial read, spawned helpers no longer inherit the
  compositor's PTY masters, X11 SHM falls back on remote displays, and
  Shift+click URL works on macOS.

### Fixes (medium, selected)

- teruwm panes honour DECTCEM (`ESC[?25l` cursor-hide); DECAWM
  (`ESC[?7l`) is honoured; CSI-intermediate sequences dispatch (DECRQM
  responds, DECSTR soft-resets); OSC-8 links apply on the non-ASCII path.
- Scrollback `line_number` stays monotonic across trims; `repaintBorderOnly`
  is actually border-only (was full-pane damage on every focus change);
  ProcessGraph growth is bounded; session deserialize + scratchpad rects
  are clamped against corrupt input; the daemon's `fds→pane` map can't go
  stale mid-loop; hook requests spanning TCP segments are read in full;
  several JSON/threshold/SGR parsing edge cases.

### dev.420 modernization

- **`@memset([]u32, runtime)` codegen bug is fixed upstream** — verified
  live; `compat.memsetU32` now uses `@memset` (SIMD lowering) in the
  render hot path instead of a scalar loop.
- Migrated 146 deprecated `std.mem.indexOf*` → `find*` and
  `std.fs.max_path_bytes` → `std.Io.Dir.max_path_bytes`.
- Replaced hardcoded POSIX literals with arch-portable std constants
  (`SA.RESTART`, `SO.PEERCRED` — the socket-peer auth check was wrong off
  x86_64 — `F.GETFL/SETFL`, `W.NOHANG`, `W.EXITSTATUS`).

### Internal

- Removed dead `populateBarDataCache` (+ 9 write-only `BarData` fields).
- Full audit recorded in `AUDIT-2026-05-30-dev420.md`.

## 0.6.11 (2026-05-16)

Post-audit hardening plus a maintainability pass. Closes the M5 (test
coverage) and LOW follow-ups from the v0.6.10 audit, fixes an MCP-server
race the new end-to-end harness caught, and completes M4 — the god-file
split.

### Fixes

- **MCP server dropped requests under a connect/send race.**
  `McpFramework.handleRequestFd` read the accepted connection once; when
  the server accepted before the client's separate `send()` landed, the
  non-blocking `read()` hit `EAGAIN` and the request was dropped (~1 in N
  under load). It now polls for the body, bounded so a wedged client
  cannot pin the event loop. Affects both the teru and teruwm MCP servers.

- **`kill` / Ctrl+C now shut teruwm down cleanly.** The compositor had no
  `SIGTERM` / `SIGINT` handler, so a signal killed the process by default
  action — clients were not torn down and the MCP socket files leaked.
  teruwm now installs `wl_event_loop_add_signal` handlers that call
  `wl_display_terminate`, so `main`'s defer chain runs: clients destroyed,
  sockets unlinked.

- **In-flight bar exec widgets are drained on shutdown.** `Bar.deinitExecs`
  now cancels any pending `exec`-widget pipe source at teardown, so a
  late-firing `execReadable` cannot run against a destroyed event loop.

### Features

- **`teruwm_zoom` MCP tool.** Exposes the Alt+scroll font-zoom path
  (`in` / `out` / `reset`) over MCP, so font size is scriptable and
  reachable from the end-to-end harness.

### Internal

- **God-file split (M4).** The three largest source files were broken into
  thin-delegator modules with no behaviour change — the public method
  surface is preserved via delegators and `pub const` re-exports:
  `Server.zig` 2183 → 1305 (new `ServerProcess`, `ServerRepeat`,
  `ServerConfig`, `ServerWindow`), `WmMcpServer.zig` 1693 → 361 (new
  `WmMcpTools`), `McpServer.zig` 1676 → 381 (new `McpServerTools`).

- **Test coverage (M5).** New `tests/teruwm_e2e.py` headless-wlroots E2E
  harness asserts spawn / tiling / zoom / shell-exit / no-CPU-spin / clean
  shutdown over MCP — the idle-bar and shell-exit checks are regression
  guards for the v0.6.10 spin blockers, and it caught the MCP race above.
  Added a `WL_EVENT` mask-bit inline test (guards the `0x10`-vs-`0x04`
  HANGUP-constant class of bug); two test fixtures' `catch unreachable` is
  now `catch |e| return e`, so a failed `bufPrint` reports as a test
  failure instead of a panic.

### Tests

517 library + 16 compositor inline tests pass; E2E harness green 8/8.

## 0.6.10 (2026-05-16)

Production-readiness pass: a new zoom feature, plus two build/runtime
blockers and a set of latent bugs surfaced by a full-codebase audit and
a live end-to-end compositor test.

### Features

- **Alt+scroll-wheel font zoom.** Hold Alt and scroll the wheel to resize
  the terminal font live — scroll up zooms in, down zooms out. Works in
  both teru (standalone, `windowed.applyFontZoom`) and teruwm (compositor,
  `ServerFont.applyFontZoom`, which refonts every pane and the bar). teruwm
  reads the Alt modifier from the seat keyboard in
  `ServerCursor.handleCursorAxis`; when `alt_scroll_zoom` is set the axis
  event is consumed as compositor chrome and not forwarded to the client.
  Configurable via `alt_scroll_zoom` in `teru.conf` and the teruwm config
  (default on).

### Fixes

- **BLOCKER — the codebase no longer fails to build on current Zig.** Zig
  `0.17.0-dev.304` removed `std.fmt.bufPrintZ` and `Allocator.dupeZ`; teru
  used both at 11 sites (`config/Hooks`, `agent/McpBridge`, `agent/forward`,
  and 8 in `render/BarRenderer`). All migrated to `std.fmt.bufPrintSentinel`
  / `Allocator.dupeSentinel`. The last green build had run on an older Zig.

- **BLOCKER — teruwm no longer spins at 100% CPU.** A bar with an `exec`
  widget (the default bottom bar has them) leaked a wlroots event source on
  every refresh: `Bar.cleanupExec` closed the command's pipe fd but never
  called `wl_event_source_remove` — the fd-handler return value the code
  relied on is ignored by libwayland. The orphaned source sat in epoll at
  permanent EOF/HUP and every event-loop dispatch re-fired its handler,
  pegging a core at 100% and leaking one pipe fd per tick until
  file-descriptor exhaustion. `cleanupExec` now removes the source before
  closing the fd; exec pipes are created `FD_CLOEXEC` so a sibling widget's
  `fork()` cannot pin them open; and a dead HANGUP branch testing the wrong
  bitmask (`0x10` — `WL_EVENT_HANGUP` is `0x04`) was removed. Verified live:
  idle CPU dropped from 99% to ~0.5%.

- **BLOCKER — exiting a shell in a teruwm pane no longer hangs the
  compositor.** When a shell exits, the PTY master fd goes to permanent
  EOF. `ptyReadable` tested `mask & 0x10` for hang-up, but
  `WL_EVENT_HANGUP` is `0x04` — the branch was dead, so
  `handleTerminalExit` (its only caller) was unreachable: the dead pane
  was never reaped, the level-triggered fd re-fired every dispatch, and
  the compositor spun at 100% CPU with a zombie pane on screen.
  Detection is now correct *and* robust — a Linux PTY master never
  raises HANGUP when its slave closes (it stays readable; `read()`
  returns `EIO`), so after a no-data read `ptyReadable` probes child
  liveness via `waitpid(WNOHANG)`. `handleTerminalExit` was itself
  incomplete (it unregistered the pane but never freed it or closed the
  PTY fd — a per-exit memory + fd leak, hidden by the dead caller); it
  now does the full `tp.deinit` + `destroy` teardown and re-seats
  keyboard focus on a surviving pane. Verified live: `exit` removes the
  pane, focus follows, CPU stays at idle.

- **Compositor shutdown could crash on a held key.** `Server.deinit`
  tears down the keybind-repeat and bar-tick timers so a late tick
  can't fire against half-destroyed state — but missed
  `terminal_repeat_src` (armed while a key autorepeats into a terminal).
  `terminalRepeatTick` does not check `shutting_down`, so a tick landing
  during `wl_display_destroy` would dereference a freed pane. The timer
  is now removed alongside its two siblings.

- **Five framebuffer fills could segfault in Debug builds.** `@memset` on a
  `[]u32` slice with a runtime colour mis-codegens on x86_64 (the rep-stosd
  lowering faults at the value's address) — still present on Zig
  `0.17.0-dev.304`. Four sites in `render/Compositor.zig` and one in
  `modes/windowed.zig` did a bare `@memset`; all now route through
  `compat.memsetU32`.

- **Silent error swallows now log.** Six `catch {}` blocks — pane
  `grid.resize` failures and a Wayland SHM-buffer recreate — discarded
  recoverable errors with no trace. They now emit `std.log.warn` with the
  error name. The SHM site's misleading "keep old buffer" comment was
  corrected.

## 0.6.9 (2026-05-06)

teruwm fix — X11 notifications, dialogs, and fixed-size HUDs now float
instead of tiling.

### Fixes

- **Notifications no longer take half the screen.** dunst (the user's
  notification daemon) maps regular X11 windows with
  `_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_NOTIFICATION` and fixed `size_hints`. The
  previous handleMap path tiled any non-override-redirect X11 window,
  stretching dunst across the workspace. `XwaylandView.handleMap` now
  detects auxiliary windows before tiling: fixed `size_hints`,
  `transient_for`, modal flag, or class allowlist
  (Dunst/dmenu/polybar/conky/screenkey/pavucontrol/polkit/xmessage/feh).
  Matching surfaces are positioned at their client-requested coords
  and kept out of the layout engine, exactly like override-redirect
  windows.

## 0.6.8 (2026-05-06)

teruwm layout fixes — two related visual bugs reported together.

### Fixes

- **Lone xdg/xwayland window no longer draws a border.** `TerminalPane`
  already suppressed the border when it was the only window on a
  workspace; this extends the same smart-border rule to browsers, xdg
  clients, and xwayland clients via `ServerLayout.arrangeWorkspace`.
  When `countInWorkspace ≤ 1` the wayland_surface border is set to
  width 0 (which destroys the rects entirely). Closing a second window
  drops the count back to 1 and the survivor's border disappears on
  the next arrange.

- **Closing an xdg client now reflows the workspace.** `XdgView.handleUnmap`
  + `handleDestroy` were removing the node from the registry/tiling
  engine but never calling `arrangeworkspace`, so closing Firefox left
  dead space where the window was — remaining tiles kept their old
  rects until the next manual arrange. Both paths now capture the
  node's workspace before removing it and arrange that workspace once
  the node is gone. Same hardening applied to `XwaylandView.handleDestroy`
  (the unmap path already arranged, but a hard client crash bypasses
  unmap).

## 0.6.7 (2026-05-06)

Hotfix on top of v0.6.6 — the Ctrl+Shift+V "freeze" fix in v0.6.6
identified the wrong root cause. This release replaces that workaround
with the real one.

### Fixes

- **Ctrl+Shift+V no longer hangs claude-code (or any bracketed-paste
  TUI) on an image clipboard.** Two bugs were compounding:

  1. xclip 0.13 (Arch + Debian as of 2026-05) silently ignores
     `-t UTF8_STRING -o` and returns the raw image bytes. The MIME
     filter added in v0.6.6 had zero effect on X11.
  2. The pasted buffer was 64 KiB, the PTY master is O_NONBLOCK, and
     `pane.ptyWrite` returned short (~4 KiB). The discarded tail
     included the closing `\x1b[201~` bracketed-paste marker, so
     claude-code stayed stuck inside the paste accumulator forever.

  Fix: `looksLikeText()` rejects clipboards that aren't valid UTF-8 or
  contain NUL / bulk control bytes — image clipboards become a silent
  no-op. `writeAllToPty()` retries partial writes with a 1 s deadline
  and explicitly emits `\x1b[201~` if the deadline trips, so a TUI
  can never be trapped mid-paste.

  Repro: take a screenshot to clipboard, open claude-code inside teru,
  Ctrl+Shift+V. Before: terminal frozen. After: silent no-op (use
  Ctrl+V to let claude-code's own handler attach the image).

## 0.6.6 (2026-05-06)

Performance + clipboard fix release on top of v0.6.5. Idle CPU drops
substantially across both binaries; Ctrl+Shift+V no longer freezes
the terminal when an image is on the clipboard.

### Fixes

- **Ctrl+Shift+V no longer hangs on image clipboards.** `wl-paste` /
  `xclip` are now invoked with an explicit text MIME type
  (`text/plain;charset=utf-8` → fallback `text/plain` on Wayland;
  `UTF8_STRING` → `STRING` on X11). If the clipboard owner only offers
  an image, both calls return zero bytes and the paste becomes a
  no-op instead of streaming multi-MB binary into the PTY.
- **Hard ~2 s deadline on `forkExecCaptureStdout`.** The shared paste
  helper now uses a non-blocking pipe + `poll()` budget. A hung or
  flooding clipboard helper is SIGKILLed; we no longer drain extra
  bytes synchronously after the buffer fills.
- **Renderer-Debug crashes from a Zig 0.17.0-dev.135 codegen bug.**
  `@memset(slice_u32, runtime_scalar)` mis-codegens on x86_64 Debug
  (rep-stosd swaps src/dst). All `[]u32` framebuffer fills now route
  through `compat.memsetU32` which is a plain `while` loop the
  compiler gets right. Repro: the `Renderer CPU tier init and render`
  test in `tier.zig`.

### Performance

- **Deadline-driven poll loops everywhere.** `daemon`, `tui`, and
  `session-attach` previously polled on fixed cadences (10/20/100 Hz)
  and woke up to do nothing. They now block until real work
  arrives. Net ~120-220 idle wakeups/sec eliminated per attached
  session. MCP listen sockets are part of the daemon poll set so MCP
  requests wake the daemon directly.
- **Vectorized cell fills.** `software.zig` now does cell + cursor
  background fills with `Vec4u32` splat (compiler fuses to AVX2). For
  a 200×50 grid that's ~160 K per-scanline `@memset` entries
  collapsed to a tight SIMD loop.
- **VtParser hot path 2-3× faster** for plain-ASCII output (cat,
  build logs, streaming). `writeGroundBatch` hoists the row base
  pointer out of the per-byte loop and tracks dirty rows correctly,
  so `renderDirty` repaints only the touched rows instead of
  fall-back-full-frame.
- **Allocator-free layout calc.** `Multiplexer.getActivePaneRect`,
  `resizePanePtys`, and `renderAllWithSelection` no longer heap-allocate
  the `Rect` slice — they use a 256-entry stack scratch buffer
  through `LayoutEngine.calculateWith`.
- **DPMS-gated bar tick.** `teruwm`'s 1 s bar tick now stretches to
  5 s when every output is asleep, eliminating /proc reads on a
  closed-lid laptop.
- **Per-vsync PTY poll throttled.** `Output.handleFrame`'s
  edge-trigger fallback now polls every frame for ≤ 4 frames after
  input, then every 16th frame as a safety net (~270 ms worst-case
  latency for missed-event recovery). 16× reduction in idle PTY
  reads per pane.

### Build

- `-Dglyphs={ascii|extended|full}` chooses the FontAtlas budget
  (351 / 447 / 959 glyphs). Default `extended` covers ASCII +
  Latin-1 + Box + Block + Geometric Shapes — what users actually
  see in 99 % of terminals.
- `Module.CreateOptions.strip` is set on every release optimize mode,
  so `zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast` emits stripped artifacts
  without needing the Makefile to post-process.
- LTO (`Compile.lto = .full`) on `ReleaseFast` and `ReleaseSmall` for
  teru, teruwm, and teruwmctl.

### Internal

- `std.ArrayListUnmanaged(T)` references migrated to `std.ArrayList(T)`
  (the unmanaged distinction was merged in Zig 0.17). `page_allocator`
  → `smp_allocator` in the small-alloc + grow-many-small paths
  (Session.zig DynWriter, Win32 WindowState).
- `build.zig.zon` `minimum_zig_version` bumped to `0.17.0-dev`.

## 0.6.5 (2026-04-19)

Cleanup release on top of v0.6.4. Dead Action variants removed, two
latent teruwm-dispatch bugs fixed, scratchpad config surface finished,
doc drift swept.

### Breaking

- `Action.send_through` (and its `send:through` parser entry) deleted.
  Was a scaffold with no handler. Delete any `send:through` config
  line; add a proper prefix-mode pass-through impl later if you need
  tmux-style literal-prefix behaviour.
- `Action.mode_locked` (and its `mode:locked` parser entry) deleted.
  The enum stub returned `.none`; nothing entered or exited the mode.
  `Mode.locked` + `shared_except_locked` kept — they're real infra
  for a future lockscreen client (`ext-session-lock-v1`).

### Features

- **Per-scratchpad spawn command wired.** `[scratchpad.NAME] cmd = …`
  actually runs the command now (was reserved-future in v0.6.4).
  `ServerScratchpad.spawn` tokenises the rule's cmd string on
  whitespace and threads it into `Pane.SpawnConfig.exec_argv`.
  Empty cmd → default shell. No shell expansion; wrap complex lines
  in `sh -c "…"`.
  ```ini
  [scratchpad.htop]
  x = 25%
  y = 25%
  w = 50%
  h = 50%
  cmd = htop
  ```
- **`Super+M` → `pane_focus_master`** (reclaimed from the v0.6.4
  launcher override). **`Super+D` → `launcher_toggle`** (xmonad-native
  dmenu chord). Match xmonad defaults again.

### Fixes

- **`pane_focus_master` no-oped in teruwm.** KeyHandler had an impl,
  `ServerInput.executeAction` didn't. Any user config binding
  `super+N = pane:focus_master` fell through silently.
- **`split_horizontal` no-oped in teruwm.** Prefix-mode `Ctrl+Space
  -` did nothing. Merged into the existing split_vertical case since
  the tiling layouts don't distinguish orientation at the compositor
  level (teru standalone still does inside one window).
- **Native terminal border colors now honour `wm_config.border_color_*`.**
  Were hardcoded in three render paths (`render`, `repaintBorderOnly`,
  `renderDirtyWithSelection`). Now pulled through a single
  `TerminalPane.borderColor()` accessor, same source XDG/XWayland
  windows already used — `[compositor] border_color_focused = #...`
  takes effect across all pane types.
- **`pane_index` registration centralised** into `TerminalPane.init`.
  Missing registration was how the v0.6.4 scratchpad-hide bug shipped
  — `createFloating` skipped the `server.pane_index.put` call.
  Centralising eliminates the class of bug.

### Cleanup

- `Server.sceneRoot()` accessor replaces 3× `miozu_scene_tree(scene)`
  duplication.
- `toggleByName()` dropped unused `default_cmd` parameter — per-name
  spawn lives on `ScratchpadRule.cmd` now.
- `sync_output_timeout_ms = 150` named constant replaces magic literal.
- Tool counts synced across README / CLAUDE / AI-INTEGRATION / MCP-API
  (20 teru + 36 teruwm = 56).
- `KEYBINDINGS.md` scratchpad defaults table fixed (was listing stale
  `term`/`htop`/`help` names instead of the v0.6.4
  `terminalBR`/`SR`/`BL`/`SL`).
- `MCP-API.md` documents `teruwm_quit` (added in v0.6.4, was missing
  from the reference).

## 0.6.4 (2026-04-19)

Scratchpad fix pack + xmonad-style keybind overhaul + terminal-input
repeat fix + MCP socket rename + teruwmctl CLI.

### Breaking

- **Socket rename** — `teru-wmmcp-$PID.sock` is now `teruwm-mcp-$PID.sock`
  (and the events channel `teru-wmmcp-events-` → `teruwm-mcp-events-`).
  The `teruwm-` prefix matches the binary name; the family namespace
  stays glob-addressable. Env vars renamed to match:
  `TERU_WMMCP_SOCKET` → `TERUWM_MCP_SOCKET`,
  `TERU_WMMCP_EVENTS_SOCKET` → `TERUWM_MCP_EVENTS_SOCKET`.
  No compat fallback — update any scripts / `.mcp.json` entries that
  reference the old paths. teru terminal's `teru-mcp-*` sockets are
  unchanged.
- **Default keybind changes** in teruwm:
  - `$mod+T` / `$mod+Shift+T` now toggle named scratchpads
    (`terminalBR` / `terminalSR`) — xmonad parity. Previously unbound.
  - `$mod+H` / `$mod+L` still shrink / grow master width; **new**
    `$mod+/` / `$mod+=` alternates for dvorak users (physical `[`/`]`).
  - `$mod+Z` was "zoom_toggle" (monocle-style claim); now an explicit
    alias for `pane_swap_master`. No behavior change in teruwm
    (zoom_toggle already did swap-with-master) — docs corrected.
  - `$mod+-` / `$mod+_` (shift + minus) are **teru standalone only**
    (font zoom). In teruwm they're unbound — see "Zoom cleanup".
  - `$mod+/` no longer enters search mode in teruwm. Use
    `Ctrl+Space /` (prefix mode) or `$mod+V /` (scroll mode) instead.

### Features

- **`teru --mcp-server --target teruwm`** — the existing MCP stdio
  bridge now routes to the compositor when invoked with
  `--target teruwm` (default stays `teru`). `--mcp-stdio` alias added
  alongside `--mcp-server` / `--mcp-bridge`. Fronts teruwm's HTTP
  MCP socket via the existing `agent/forward.zig` client.
- **`teruwmctl` binary** — new shell CLI + MCP stdio adapter for
  teruwm, installed at `zig-out/bin/teruwmctl` (Linux only; pure
  client — no wlroots). Verb form maps `teruwmctl list-windows`
  → `teruwm_list_windows`, generic form `teruwmctl call <tool>
  '{…}'`, `--mcp-stdio` alias for MCP-aware clients. Examples:
  ```sh
  teruwmctl list-windows
  teruwmctl spawn-terminal
  teruwmctl switch-workspace '{"workspace":2}'
  teruwmctl screenshot '{"path":"/tmp/s.png"}'
  teruwmctl call teruwm_set_layout '{"layout":"grid"}'
  ```
  Claude Code / Cursor registration:
  ```json
  {"mcpServers": {"teruwm": {
    "command": "teruwmctl",
    "args": ["--mcp-stdio"]
  }}}
  ```
  Internally the stdio path delegates to `McpBridge.run(io, .teruwm)`
  — same transport as `teru --mcp-server --target teruwm`.
- **Per-name scratchpad geometry** — new `[scratchpad.NAME]` config
  section binds x/y/w/h (fraction or percent) per scratchpad, mirroring
  xmonad's `customFloating (RationalRect …)`. Four defaults ship
  pre-registered matching the reference xmonad layout:
  `terminalBR` / `terminalSR` / `terminalBL` / `terminalSL`. Evaluated
  at each `show()` against the active output's dimensions so
  multi-monitor + resolution change work automatically.
  ```ini
  [scratchpad.terminalBR]
  x = 42%
  y = 3%
  w = 57%
  h = 78%
  ```
- **`teruwm_quit` MCP tool** — terminates the compositor cleanly from
  MCP. Mirrors `Mod+Shift+Q`. Response returns before `wl_display_terminate`
  so the client sees the ack.
- **`teruwmctl watch` subcommand** — streams the compositor's event
  channel (`workspace_switched`, `focus_changed`, `urgent`,
  `window_mapped`) as newline-JSON to stdout until EOF.
- **`teruwmctl` positional args** — 20+ verbs accept shell-style
  positional parameters (`teruwmctl notify hello`,
  `teruwmctl switch-workspace 3`, `teruwmctl click 100 200`, …). JSON
  form still works as an escape hatch.
- **`$mod+`` ` alias** — xmonad-familiar toggle between last two
  workspaces (same as `$mod+Escape`).
- **`ipc.buildPathFamily(family, prefix, name)`** — new helper so
  binaries can own their own socket family (`teruwm-*` vs `teru-*`)
  instead of sharing the single hardcoded `teru-` prefix.

### Fixes

- **Scratchpad hide no-op on real DRM** (the bug that bit for hours of
  debugging). Two root causes layered on top of each other:
  1. `TerminalPane.createFloating` skipped registering the pane in
     `server.pane_index`, so `Server.terminalPaneById(nid)` returned
     `null` on every hide/show. The `if |tp|` block in
     `ServerScratchpad.hide()` / `show()` silently fell through — only
     the workspace field in the node registry flipped, nothing at the
     scene-graph level changed. Visible symptom: `teruwm_list_windows`
     showed `workspace=255` immediately, but the scratchpad stayed
     visible on screen.
  2. Even after fixing (1), `wlr_scene_node_set_enabled(false)` alone
     didn't always cause wlroots to page-flip the DRM output. The
     scene-node → output damage propagation could drop the
     enable-transition, leaving the eDP-1 front buffer showing the
     last good frame. Fixed by reparenting the scene buffer into a
     permanently-disabled `Server.hidden_tree` on hide instead of
     relying on the enabled flag — reparenting always damages both
     the old and new AABBs, which reliably flips.
- **Terminal-input key repeat** — holding Backspace (or any key) on a
  teru-native pane only deleted one character because libinput doesn't
  emit repeat events and teru-native panes have no Wayland client to
  implement client-side repeat from `repeat_info`. Added a
  `terminal_repeat_src` timer on Server that rearms at 40 ms ticks
  after a 400 ms initial delay, matching the rate advertised to
  Wayland clients. Canceled on release, modifier change, or a
  different key press.
- **MCP socket FD leak across fork/exec** — `acceptPosix` didn't set
  `FD_CLOEXEC`. Scratchpad (and tiled) terminal spawns inherited the
  MCP request fd, keeping the socket open after `Server.poll()`
  closed its end, which hung MCP clients reading for EOF. Set
  `FD_CLOEXEC` immediately after accept. Affected every tool that
  triggers a shell fork (`spawn_terminal`, `scratchpad`).
- **Double-escape bug in list tools** — `teruwm_list_workspaces`,
  `teruwm_list_windows`, `teruwm_list_widgets` emitted `\\\"` (three
  backslashes + quote) inside the `text` field instead of `\"`,
  producing doubly-encoded JSON. `teruwmctl` now also unescapes the
  `text` field once before printing, so the clean shape is visible
  to users.

### Cleanup

- **Zoom actions in teruwm removed** — `.zoom_in` / `.zoom_out` /
  `.zoom_reset` were byte-identical aliases for `resize_grow_w` /
  `resize_shrink_w` / `master_ratio = 0.6` in the compositor. Removed
  from `ServerInput.executeAction` (teruwm) and from
  `isRepeatableAction`. `zoom_toggle` kept — it's a distinct action
  (swap-with-master). Teru standalone still uses all four for font
  zoom (`loadTerminalZoomDefaults`).
- **Load-order fix for scratchpad rules** — `applyDefaultScratchpadRules`
  now runs after `wm_config.load()` so user's `[scratchpad.NAME]`
  sections aren't wiped.

## 0.6.3 (2026-04-18)

Patch release — windowed-mode power draw + Wayland-client crash + drag-select efficiency.

### Fixes

- **windowed mode** — event-driven main loop. windowed.zig used to
  sleep on a fixed 8/16 ms timer, waking the CPU ~60 Hz even with
  nothing to do. New `waitForInput` uses `posix.poll()` on the
  Wayland/X11 display fd, every PTY master, the daemon/hook-listener/
  config-watcher fds, with a timeout equal to the nearest scheduled
  deadline (cursor-blink flip, 60 fps frame cap, persist debounce,
  500 ms hard cap). Measured: teru idle CPU 0.144% → 0.022% (−85%),
  system power 20.765 W → 20.699 W (−66 mW) across 3 × 30 s trials.
- **windowed mode** — cursor blink is now focus-gated. When the
  window isn't focused, blink doesn't fire at all (no wakeups every
  530 ms for a caret the user isn't watching). When focused, blink
  marks only the cursor row dirty via `markRowDirty` instead of
  setting `grid.dirty = true`, which used to force a full SIMD
  repaint of the entire framebuffer (~16 MB at 2560×1600) every
  530 ms. One-row per blink now.
- **platform/wayland** — WaylandWindow.init allocated `state` on the
  stack and passed `&state` as the listener data pointer to every
  `wl_*_add_listener` call. The state was copied-by-value into
  WaylandWindow on return; the listeners kept pointing at the
  since-freed stack slot and panicked with an index-out-of-bounds
  inside `pushEvent` the first time any Wayland event dispatched.
  Heap-allocate via `std.heap.c_allocator` so the pointer stays stable.
  Visible effect: teru now launches successfully as an xdg_toplevel
  against an outer Wayland compositor.
- **compositor** — narrow drag-select invalidation. Previously every
  pointer motion during a drag called `grid.markAllDirty()`, so each
  motion tick re-rendered every cell. Measured 4.46% teruwm CPU +
  300 mW system power during sustained drag. Motion now marks only
  the union of {previous-end, new-end, start} screen rows dirty —
  exactly the cells whose selection-bg state can flip between ticks.
  Typical drag spans 1-5 rows per tick; on an 80×50 grid that's ~50×
  less work per motion.

## 0.6.2 (2026-04-18)

Patch release — teruwm-native terminal panes now support mouse text
selection, and hover no longer flickers near the cursor. The previously
published 0.6.2 shipped an unrelated Wayland-client queue fix that
didn't address either user-reported symptom — that tag has been replaced
with this commit.

### Fixes

- **teruwm** — text selection inside native terminal panes now works.
  Panes created by `teruwm_spawn_terminal` are `wlr_scene_buffer` nodes
  backed by libteru with no wl_surface, so `wlr_seat_pointer_notify_*`
  had nowhere to deliver pointer events. New teruwm-internal path feeds
  cursor coords into the pane's own `Selection` / `MouseState` and the
  `SoftwareRenderer` now applies a `selection_bg` overlay per-cell.
- **teruwm** — hover no longer flickers near the mouse cursor. Cache
  the last xcursor image name server-side; skip `wlr_cursor_set_xcursor`
  when the shape matches what's already set. Without this, hovering
  over a surface-less terminal scene_buffer re-set the cursor on every
  motion packet, which re-damaged the cursor plane at mouse rate and
  visibly rippled the pixels under the cursor.
- **teruwm_type / teruwm_press** (MCP) now route to the focused
  terminal pane's PTY via `tp.writeInput`, mirroring the real-keyboard
  special-case in `ServerInput.handleKeyEvent`. Previously these tools
  called `wlr_seat_keyboard_notify_key` which has no destination for
  native panes, so MCP-driven testing of terminal keyboard was a no-op.
  xdg / xwayland fallback path preserved.

### Internals

- `SoftwareRenderer` gains `renderWithSelection` + `renderDirtyWithSelection`;
  `renderRange` is now a thin wrapper over `renderRangeSel` that
  threads an optional `Selection` + scroll/sb params.
- `TerminalPane` carries `selection: Selection` and `mouse: MouseState`;
  `Server` tracks `drag_terminal: ?*TerminalPane` so drags that leave
  the pane rect still pin the far end at the cursor.
- `.claude/rules/compositor-mcp-testing.md` — new playbook for
  driving teruwm from MCP and verifying changes via pane screenshots.
  Codifies: MCP routing quirks, DRM contention handling, what
  screenshots can and cannot capture.

## 0.6.1 (2026-04-17)

Patch release — one bug.

### Fixes

- **teruwm**: TerminalPane honours DEC private mode 2026 (synchronized
  output). Regressed during the Server.zig module split that shipped in
  0.6.0's refactor batch — apps that batch their paints between
  `ESC[?2026h` / `ESC[?2026l` (Claude Code, Ink, fzf, ratatui) no
  longer flicker as the compositor painted every intermediate write.
  Adds a 150 ms fall-through timeout so a buggy client that never
  closes the batch can't freeze the pane (matches Alacritty).

## 0.6.0 (2026-04-17)

The protocol-completion milestone. 80+ commits since v0.5.0 land a fully
functional desktop-grade compositor experience: every protocol Chromium,
Vivaldi, Emacs, GIMP, and figma-linux need is now implemented, all
live-hardware crash clusters from the v0.5.0 era are resolved, and the MCP
surface gains physical-input primitives for AI-driven GUI automation.

### Features — teruwm compositor protocols

- **foreign_toplevel_management_v1** — waybar taskbar MVP; toplevels published and closeable from external clients.
- **wlr_output_management_v1** — full kanshi, wlr-randr, and wdisplays support.
- **virtual_keyboard_v1 + virtual_pointer_v1** — synthetic keyboard and pointer input.
- **output_power_management_v1** — DPMS on/off/standby via wlopm and swayidle.
- **cursor_shape_v1** — correct pointer/text/grab/resize cursors over browsers and Electron apps.
- **presentation-time frame callbacks** — fixes Chromium/Vivaldi "stuck on splash screen".
- **wp_viewporter + 5 chromium/vivaldi protocols (pack #1 + #2)** — completes the set required for GPU-composited clients to render correctly.
- **data_control_v1 clipboard, tearing protocol, idle_inhibit (pack #2)**.
- **zxdg_output_manager_v1** — enables grim and wlr-screencopy to work correctly.
- **[keyboard] config section + 3 protocol globals** — tap-to-click, natural-scroll, disable-while-typing, clickfinger defaults applied per libinput device.

### Features — teruwm UX

- **Scene-rect borders on all windows** — xdg + xwayland (not just teru terminals); `border_color_focused`, `border_color_unfocused`, `border_width` config knobs; `border_width = 0` disables; ARGB alpha supported for translucent borders.
- **Key repeat for held keybinds** — resize, focus/swap cycle, master count, zoom; 40 ms rate / 400 ms delay (sway-style).
- **Touchpad defaults** — tap-to-click, drag, natural-scroll, disable-while-typing, clickfinger applied automatically per libinput device.
- **Floating window focus** — `Mod+J/K` now cycles through floating windows in addition to tiled ones.
- **Shifted digit keybinds** — `Mod+Shift+1..0` works on number-row shifted symbols (`!@#$%^&*()`); un-shifted back to digit before keybind lookup.
- **Emacs/Steam/X11 close** — `Mod+Shift+C` now closes any X11 client via `wlr_xwayland_surface_close`.
- **Float/tile semantics clarified** — `Mod+S` is unfloat-only; tile→float is `Mod+drag` (xmonad/bspwm semantics).
- **Menu keybind** — moved from `Mod+D` to `Mod+M`.
- **Launcher repaint fix** — Esc-from-launcher now correctly repaints the bar (forced dirty flag past signature dedupe).
- **Close-last-terminal** — no longer leaves a ghost image on the output.

### Features — AI-first MCP

- **Unified McpFramework** — comptime-generic over `Impl` type; single codebase shared by teru agent server and teruwm compositor server.
- **teruwm_mouse_path** — humanised cursor trajectory tool for browser/GUI automation.
- **teruwm_click / teruwm_type / teruwm_press / teruwm_scroll** — physical input primitives for AI-driven GUI control.

### Bug fixes

- **Chromium/Vivaldi clicks land** — input-region filter + distinct button timestamps prevent duplicate events.
- **Vivaldi loading splash** — `wlr_scene_output_send_frame_done` call added; no more freeze on splash.
- **Emacs/Steam/GIMP XWayland keyboard focus** — `wlr_seat_keyboard_notify_enter` on the xwayland `wlr_surface` (not the parent).
- **Emacs maps at correct size** — `Node.applyRect` dispatches to `wlr_xwayland_surface_configure` for xwayland slots; no more 1×1 square.
- **4 shutdown crashes** — defer order, `wl_display_destroy_clients` before `wl_display_destroy`, `shutting_down` guard in `Output.handleDestroy`, gentler scene-buffer teardown.
- **figma-linux + Electron clicks** — fallback pointer to toplevel root when every subsurface rejects the input region.
- **Scroll offset wrap** — `u32→i32` cast guarded against silent overflow.
- **8 silent `catch {}` sites** — now log real failures instead of swallowing them.
- **XdgView handleDestroy** — no longer pre-removes FTL links before the toplevel is fully torn down.
- **Server.deinit** — properly unregisters all listeners and frees collections.
- **execRestart** — buffer sizing corrected; `FD_CLOEXEC` restored on exec failure.
- **scheduleRender** — iterates all outputs, not just primary.

### Refactors (non-breaking)

- **Server.zig split** — decomposed into 8 focused modules: `ServerListeners`, `ServerInput`, `ServerCursor`, `ServerFocus`, `ServerLayout`, `ServerScratchpad`, `ServerRestart`, `ServerScreenshot`.
- **main.zig split** — decomposed into `modes/` subdirectory: `common`, `raw`, `tui`, `windowed`, `daemon`.
- **McpFramework** — comptime-generic unification; one codebase, two server instantiations.
- **FontSynth** — box-drawing synthesis extracted from `FontAtlas`.
- **Retire `miozu_output_layout_first_*`** — replaced by `activeOutputDims`.
- **stbtt externs** — hand-declared; `@cImport` dropped.

### Performance

- **O(1) `Node.findById` + `terminalPaneById`** — `AutoHashMap` indices replace linear scans.
- **Bar render dedupe** — signature-based short-circuit skips SIMD blit on unchanged frames.
- **FBA arrange scratch** — zero heap allocation per vsync in layout engine.
- **pixman damage regions** — scene buffer commits carry precise damage, reducing GPU blit cost.
- **`barSignature`** — reads `urgent_count` and push counter in O(1).
- **Border-only focus repaint** — saves N×300 µs per focus flip by repainting only border rects.

No breaking config changes. No breaking MCP API changes. All additions are purely additive — upgrade is drop-in.

## 0.5.0 (2026-04-13)

The xmonad-parity milestone. 25 patches since 0.4.1 landed a tiling Wayland
compositor (`teruwm`), a 48-tool two-server MCP surface, multi-output support,
session save/restore, and a defensive crash-hardening pass driven by live
chromium/tty testing.

### Features — teruwm (wlroots Wayland compositor)
- **xmonad master workflow** — `$mod+M` focus-master, `$mod+Shift+M` swap-master, `$mod+,/.` adjust master count, `$mod+Ctrl+J/K` rotate slaves.
- **Named scratchpads** — xmonad `NamedScratchpad` model with `HIDDEN_WS` sentinel; toggles park/unpark a tagged pane on any workspace.
- **DynamicProjects** — per-workspace startup hooks via `[workspace.N]` config.
- **Multi-output (3-rule architecture)** — Node.workspace is identity, Output.workspace is a viewport, visibility derives. `$mod+O` cycle output, `$mod+Shift+O` move across outputs.
- **Float toggle + sink all** — `$mod+S` toggles floating; `$mod+Ctrl+S` sinks every floater back into tiling.
- **Zoom / fullscreen** — `$mod+Z` monocle on focused pane, `$mod+F` true fullscreen (bars hidden).
- **Session save/restore** — `.tsess` snapshots; hot-restart preserves PTY fds across `exec`.
- **Screen capture** — `wlr-screencopy` native compositor screenshots, area select, fade-unfocused, record presets.
- **Smart borders** — drawn only when there are peers; sole pane renders borderless.
- **`[autostart]` section** — compositor launches user programs on ready.
- **xdg_activation_v1 urgency** — hidden clients flash an urgency pill in the bar.
- **XWayland lazy-start** — spawned on first X11 client connect; absent at runtime without penalty.
- **Spawn chords** — 32 user-defined `spawn_0..31` keybind slots.
- **Default close chord: `$mod+Shift+C`** — matches xmonad `mod-shift-c`; `$mod+X` is no longer bound.

### Features — MCP surface
- **Two-server architecture** — 20-tool agent MCP (`teru-mcp-*.sock`) + 28-tool compositor MCP (`teru-wmmcp-*.sock`); 48 tools total.
- **Cross-server forwarding** — `teruwm_*` calls on the agent socket transparently forward to the compositor socket.
- **Event push channel** — `teru-*mcp-events-*.sock` with `subscribe_events` tool, JSON-line stream (`window_mapped`, `focus_changed`, `workspace_switched`, `urgent`, `window_closed`).
- **In-band MCP** — OSC 9999 query + DCS 9999 reply lets headless agents drive teru without a socket.
- **Line-JSON dispatch** — comptime tool table, no per-call allocation.

### Features — teru (terminal)
- **DECLRMM left/right scroll margins** — IL/DL/ICH/DCH margin-aware.
- **Native PNG screenshots**, Braille + geometric glyphs (352 new), DECTCEM cursor visibility.

### Fixes — defensive crash-hardening (v0.4.19..v0.4.27)
Six coredump-grade bugs triaged during live chromium/tty testing; all shared one root shape — wlroots scene/seat invariants violated by a stale or foreign surface.
- **Surface liveness guard** — `miozu_surface_is_live` checks `resource && mapped` before any seat-notify or cursor-surface call.
- **Cursor-request filter** — `request_set_cursor` rejected from any client other than the focused pointer client (matches sway/river).
- **Scene node type check** — `wlr_scene_node_at` returns rect/tree/buffer; pre-filter buffer nodes before `wlr_scene_buffer_from_node`.
- **Grab-on-close invariant** — every close path nulls `focused_terminal`, `focused_view`, and `grab_node_id` before freeing the backing pane/view.
- **Workspace.removeNode** clears `active_node` and `master_id` when they equal the removed id.
- **DCS parser isolation** — `ESC` inside a DCS body routes through a dedicated sub-state, never the general `.escape` state.
- **XDG click-to-focus** — sets `server.focused_view` via `focusView()`; prior to this, `$mod+Shift+C` / `$mod+S` on a Wayland client no-op'd or targeted the wrong window.
- **XDG view unmap/destroy UAF** — clears focused_view and grab state before surface destruction.

### Build / CI
- Version single source of truth: `build.zig` line 10; propagated via `build_options.version`.
- 488 inline tests.

### Documentation
- Full rewrite of `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/MCP-API.md` (48 tools), `docs/KEYBINDINGS.md`, `docs/INSTALLING.md`, `docs/BENCHMARKS.md`.
- `CLAUDE.md` crash catalogue with symptom → trigger → root cause → fix mapping.

## 0.4.1 (2026-04-10)

### Features
- **DECLRMM left/right scroll margins** — full DECSLRM support: IL/DL/ICH/DCH respect margins, cursor constraining, wrap/newline/erase margin-aware. Fixes tmux vertical split rendering.
- **Homebrew tap** — `brew install nicholasglazer/teru/teru` for macOS distribution.
- **Scoop manifest** — `scoop install teru` for Windows distribution.
- **New shortcuts** — `Alt+B` toggle status bar, `Alt+Enter` new pane, `Alt+\` zoom reset.
- **`-e` exec flag** — `teru -e htop` runs a command instead of shell.
- **`--no-bar` flag** — start with status bar hidden.
- **Nesting detection** — refuses to open a teru window inside an existing teru session.

### Fixes
- Mouse selection off by one row (padding not subtracted from coordinates).
- Selection no longer blinks or disappears during/after drag.
- Windows IME properly disabled — fixes CJK character input.
- Windows keyboard layout change handling.
- LF no longer resets cursor column — fixes tmux vertical splits.
- DECLRMM margin compliance: eraseChars unbounded, DECSLRM homes cursor, CR respects left margin, alt screen clears margins, wrap/newline margin-aware.
- Mouse cursor properly restored on click and motion (3 fixes).
- Wayland cursor hide/show safety — no-op without cursor surface.
- `Alt+D` no longer kills local mode — shows notification instead.

### Documentation
- Added `mouse_hide_when_typing`, `word_delimiters`, `bar_left`/`bar_center`/`bar_right` to CONFIGURATION.md.
- Fixed workspace range 0-8 → 0-9 in AI-INTEGRATION.md.
- Added `input/` module to architecture docs.
- Removed stale macOS Intel binary from install docs (CI only builds aarch64).

## 0.4.0 (2026-04-10)

### Architecture
- **Daemon-backed windowed mode** — `teru -n NAME` auto-starts a background daemon, connects full windowed UI. Close window → daemon survives. Reopen → reconnects with same panes + content. Cross-platform IPC (Unix sockets / named pipes).
- **Pane backend abstraction** — `RemotePty` enables panes backed by daemon IPC instead of local PTYs. Unified accessors: `pane.ptyWrite()`, `pane.ptyRead()`, `pane.childPid()`.
- **State sync protocol** — daemon sends full workspace/pane state on client connect: layout, master ratio, zoom, active pane, pane positions. Under 50ms reconnect.

### Features
- **Template system** — `teru -n prod -t claude-power` starts from `.tsess` template. Templates define workspaces, layouts, panes, commands, CWDs. Searched in `~/.config/teru/templates/`.
- **Clean CLI** — `teru` (fresh scratchpad), `teru -n NAME` (persistent), `teru -l` (list), `-t`/`-f`/`-v`/`-h` short flags.
- **10 workspaces** — Alt+0 = workspace 10. Matches tmux `M-0 → window 10`.
- **Clickable status bar** — click workspace indicators to switch.
- **Native PNG screenshots** — `teru_screenshot` MCP tool, pure Zig encoder, zero deps.
- **Copy/paste keybind actions** — `copy:selection` and `paste:clipboard` wired to config.
- **`restore_layout` / `persist_session` split** — lightweight layout restore vs full daemon persistence.
- **MCP bridge auto-discovery** — scans for teru socket when `$TERU_MCP_SOCKET` not set.
- **MCP read-only mode** — `TERU_MCP_READONLY=1` filters write tools.
- **Braille + geometric glyphs** — 352 new glyphs (⠋⠙⠹⠸ spinners, ◇◆●○ task lists).
- **DECTCEM cursor visibility** — cursor hidden when apps use ESC[?25l (fixes spinner artifacts).
- **Example session** — `examples/claude-power.tsess` (10 workspaces, 34 panes, production tmux replacement).
- **Systemd service** — `pkg/teru.service` for daemon auto-start on login.

### Security
- **JSON injection fixed** — MCP tool responses escape all user-controlled strings.
- **Protocol bounds checks** — payload overflow, workspace index validation, grid bounds.
- **Path safety** — macOS uses `$TMPDIR`, Linux uses `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`.
- **Scrollback OOM cap** — `scrollback_lines` capped at 1M.

### Refactoring
- Mouse handling extracted to `src/input/mouse.zig` (−370 lines from main.zig).
- MCP helpers extracted to `src/agent/McpTools.zig` (−157 lines from McpServer).
- XKB keysym constants extracted to `src/input/keysyms.zig`.
- Layout parsing deduplicated into `Layout.parse`/`Layout.name`.
- Named constants replace 11 magic numbers.
- Global `g_wm_class` replaced with parameter threading.
- Silent `catch {}` blocks annotated, session save logged.
- `auto_start=false` fixed — spawns shell, types command without Enter.
- Selection cleared when PTY output changes grid content.
- Consistent `grid_rows` calculation across init, resize, and render.
- Protocol fuzz tests (8) + braille/geometric tests (16).

### Stats
- 526 inline tests (up from 451)
- 19 MCP tools
- 60 source files, 32K lines
- Cross-platform: Linux (X11+Wayland), macOS, Windows

## 0.3.10 (2026-04-10)

### Features
- **Clean CLI** — simplified interface: `teru` starts a fresh scratchpad, `teru -n NAME` creates/attaches a persistent named session (daemon auto-started), `teru -n NAME -t TEMPLATE` starts from a .tsess template, `teru -l` lists sessions.
- **Template system** — `.tsess` files define multi-workspace sessions (workspaces, layouts, panes, commands, CWDs). Searched in `~/.config/teru/templates/` then `./examples/`. Export current session via `teru_session_save` MCP tool.
- **Pane backend abstraction** — `RemotePty` in `src/pty/` enables daemon-backed windowed mode where panes connect to a running daemon instead of owning PTYs directly.
- **Full state sync** — workspace position, focus, master ratio, and zoom state preserved across daemon attach/detach cycles.
- **`restore_layout` config option** — save layout on exit, restore on launch (fresh shells, no daemon). Separate from `persist_session` which keeps processes alive.
- **`persist_session` config option** — keep processes alive between window closes via auto-daemon.

### Fixes
- **JSON injection in MCP tools** — all MCP tool responses properly escape user-controlled strings.
- **Scrollback OOM protection** — bounded scrollback allocation prevents runaway memory growth.
- **Audit critical fixes** — bounds checks on CSI params, path traversal protection in session names, input validation on MCP tool arguments.
- **State sync active_pane_id** — uses full u64, matches `?u64` Workspace.active_node type.
- **pane.pty to pane.backend** — fixed missed migration in `spawnPaneWithCommand` + platform dispatch.
- **Stale selection cleared** — selection highlight no longer persists when PTY output changes grid content.

### Refactoring
- Deduplicated layout parsing into `Layout.parse`/`Layout.name` (types.zig).
- Extracted hardcoded magic numbers into named constants.
- Annotated safe `catch {}` blocks, log session save failures instead of silently dropping.

### Testing
- 8 protocol robustness fuzz tests for malformed wire messages.
- 499+ inline tests (up from 480).

## 0.3.9 (2026-04-09)

### Features
- **10 workspaces** — Alt+0 switches to workspace 10 (was zoom_reset). Matches tmux `M-0 → window 10` pattern. All arrays expanded from [9] to [10] across LayoutEngine, Config, Session, Keybinds, platform keycodes (Linux/macOS/Windows).
- **Example session: `claude-power.tsess`** — 10-workspace 34-pane session config replicating a production tmux setup with Claude Code instances, monitoring scripts, and dev servers.

### Fixes
- **Selection drift** — mouse selection highlight no longer drifts upward when new terminal output pushes lines to scrollback. Selection rows now track scrollback growth.
- **macOS TIOCSWINSZ/TIOCSCTTY** — ioctl constants missing from Zig's std.posix.T added to compat.zig with correct c_int type for libc ioctl signature.
- **macOS objc_msgSend_stret** — does not exist on arm64; use regular objc_msgSend on Apple Silicon.
- **macOS builtin import** — missing in platform.zig, broke Windows cross-compile.
- **IPC buildPath test** — works on macOS (path format differs per OS).

## 0.3.8 (2026-04-09)

### Features
- **Event-driven session persistence** — `persist_session = true` auto-saves session state on every meaningful change (pane spawn/close, layout cycle, workspace switch, focus, resize, zoom, swap, move). No polling — dirty flag with 100ms debounce.
- **Workspace-aware restore** — on startup, restores pane count per workspace with correct layouts and master ratios (session format v2, backwards-compatible with v1).
- **Auto-attach to daemon** — if a daemon session named "default" is running, teru auto-attaches instead of starting fresh.
- **`ensureDirC()`** — recursive directory creation helper for session storage path.

### Files
- Session files stored at `$XDG_STATE_HOME/teru/sessions/{name}.bin`
- 14 `markDirty()` call sites across all Multiplexer mutation methods
- Debounced save in both windowed and daemon event loops
- Final save on clean exit

## 0.3.7 (2026-04-09)

### Features
- **Native PNG screenshots** (`src/png.zig`) — pure Zig PNG encoder (stored deflate, CRC32, Adler-32). Zero external dependencies. Captures ARGB framebuffer directly.
- **`teru_screenshot` MCP tool** — agents capture the terminal framebuffer as PNG via MCP. Returns file path and dimensions. Windowed mode only (X11/Wayland).
- **19 MCP tools** — added `teru_session_save`, `teru_session_restore`, `teru_screenshot`
- **SECURITY.md** — vulnerability reporting policy and scope documentation
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — contributor guide with setup, workflow, and help-wanted areas

### Build system
- **Single version source of truth** — `build.zig` line 10 defines version, propagated via `build_options.version` to main.zig, McpServer.zig, and PosixPty.zig at compile time. No more manual multi-file version syncing.
- **`make bump-version V=x.y.z`** — updates build.zig + build.zig.zon in one command
- **`zig build check`** — semantic analysis without linking, for cross-platform CI

### Fixes
- **MCP JSON escaping** — 6 tool responses had broken JSON from raw string `\\"` semantics; all fixed
- **VI mode crash** — replaced `unreachable` with null guard when active pane closes during keypress
- **Windows cross-compile** — SignalManager tests use `i32` instead of `posix.fd_t` (which is `*anyopaque` on Windows)
- **`TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION`** — now set from `build_options.version` instead of hardcoded string

### Documentation
- **README rewrite** — etymology, comparison table, quick start, AI integration guide, accurate feature counts
- **docs/AI-INTEGRATION.md** — complete MCP tool reference (19 tools), socket paths per platform, OSC 9999 protocol
- **docs/ARCHITECTURE.md** — rewritten to match current codebase
- **docs/INSTALLING.md** — removed stale Homebrew/Nix references
- **site/index.html** — landing page for teru.sh with structured data

### Stats
- 480+ inline tests (up from 451)
- 19 MCP tools (up from 16)

## 0.3.5 (2026-04-07)

### Cross-platform
- **PTY comptime dispatch** (`src/pty/pty.zig`) — single import point selects POSIX Pty or WinPty per OS; all 6 consumers migrated
- **Non-blocking WinPty read** — PeekNamedPipe + ReadFile replaces blocking ReadFile; returns `error.WouldBlock` matching POSIX O_NONBLOCK pattern; no threads needed
- **IPC abstraction** (`src/server/ipc.zig`) — cross-platform listen/accept/connect/buildPath: Unix sockets (POSIX) / named pipes (Windows)
- **All IPC consumers migrated** — daemon, McpServer, PaneBackend, HookListener, McpBridge use `ipc.zig` instead of raw socket calls
- **Windows raw mode** (`Terminal.zig`) — SetConsoleMode + WaitForMultipleObjects event loop for `teru --raw`
- **Windows ConPTY** (`src/pty/WinPty.zig`) — CreatePseudoConsole, pipe pairs, STARTUPINFOEX, ResizePseudoConsole
- **Windows clipboard** — Win32 OpenClipboard/SetClipboardData/GetClipboardData with UTF-8/UTF-16 conversion

- **macOS HookListener fix** — replaced Linux-only `accept4` with portable `ipc.accept`
- **Portable O_NONBLOCK** — `compat.O_NONBLOCK` (0x800 Linux, 0x0004 macOS) replaces all hardcoded values
- **Portable IPC paths** — `ipc.buildPath`: `/run/user/{uid}/teru-*` (Linux), `/tmp/teru-{uid}-*` (macOS), `\\.\pipe\teru-*` (Windows)
- **Portable readlink** — McpServer uses `std.c.readlink` instead of `linux.readlinkat`
- **Pane.readAndProcess** — uses `self.pty.read()` instead of `posix.read(pty.master)`
- **Clipboard paste** — uses `pty.write()` instead of `std.c.write(pty.master)`
- **Zero raw socket calls** outside `ipc.zig` (all migrated)

### Fixes
- **Stale version env** — `TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION` in Pty.zig updated to match current version
- **macOS listSessions** — prefix matching now accounts for `teru-{uid}-session-*` format

## 0.3.4 (2026-04-07)

### Cross-platform
- **macOS keyboard translation** — IOKit keycode → UTF-8 via static lookup tables (no Carbon dependency), XKB-compatible keysyms, full modifier tracking (Shift, Ctrl, Option, Cmd, Caps Lock)
- **Windows keyboard translation** — VK code → UTF-8 via ToUnicode Win32 API, dead key support, full modifier tracking, XKB-compatible keysyms

## 0.3.3 (2026-04-07)

### Cross-platform
- **Cross-platform clipboard** — macOS uses `pbcopy`/`pbpaste`, Windows stub for Win32 clipboard API
- **Cross-platform font discovery** — macOS searches `/System/Library/Fonts` (SF Mono, Menlo, Monaco), Windows searches `C:\Windows\Fonts` (Consolas, Cascadia)
- **Cross-platform URL opener** — macOS uses `/usr/bin/open`, Linux uses `xdg-open`, Windows stub for `ShellExecuteW`
- **Portable PTY** — replaced `linux.fork()`/`linux.exit()` with `compat.posixFork()`/`posixExit()` in Pty.zig (works on macOS)
- **macOS platform** — added mouse events, focus tracking, cursor hide/show (pending agent)
- **Windows platform** — Win32 window stub with full event handling (pending agent)

## 0.3.2 (2026-04-07)

### Cross-platform
- **Portable time abstraction** — `compat.monotonicNow()` replaces all `std.os.linux.clock_gettime` calls across main.zig, Multiplexer, Ui, Hooks, McpServer (supports Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **Portable process helpers** — `compat.getPid()`, `compat.getUid()`, `compat.sleepNs()` replace direct `linux.getpid/getuid/nanosleep` in daemon, McpServer, PaneBackend, HookListener

- Zero `std.os.linux.*` references outside of `compat.zig` and `src/platform/linux/`

## 0.3.1 (2026-04-07)

### Features
- **`include` directive** — split config across files: `include keybindings.conf` (relative to `~/.config/teru/`, absolute paths supported, max depth 4)

### Fixes
- **Viewport height** — reverted cell-aligned snapping that wasted up to cell_height-1 pixels at the bottom; panes now use full available space

## 0.3.0 (2026-04-07)

### Features
- **Global shortcuts** — Alt+key actions without prefix key, Right Alt for pane manipulation
  - `Alt+1-9` switch workspace, `RAlt+1-9` move pane to workspace

  - `Alt+C` vertical split, `RAlt+C` horizontal split, `Alt+X` close pane
  - `Alt+M` focus master pane, `RAlt+M` mark pane as master
  - `Alt+-` / `Alt+=` font size zoom out/in
- **Master pane** — mark any pane as master per workspace, jump back from anywhere
- **Font size zoom** — re-rasterizes from memory (no file I/O), deferred SIGWINCH (150ms debounce)
- **Workspace attention colors** — non-active workspaces with output highlighted in red
- **Cell-aligned layout rects** — pane grids fill available space exactly, no gaps
- **Cross-platform keycode abstraction** — Linux (evdev), macOS (IOKit), Windows (VK) keycode tables

### Config
- `alt_workspace_switch = true` — enable/disable all Alt+key shortcuts
- `attention_color = #EB3137` — workspace attention indicator color

### Internal
- `FontAtlas.rasterizeAtSize()` — re-rasterize from in-memory font data
- `KeyHandler.handleGlobalKey()` — centralized global shortcut dispatch
- Platform `keycodes` struct with `digitToWorkspace()` function per platform
- `Workspace.master_id` and `Workspace.attention` fields
- `Multiplexer.movePaneToWorkspace()`, `swapPaneNext/Prev()`, `setMaster()`, `focusMaster()`

## 0.2.8 (2026-04-06)

### Features
- **Per-workspace layout lists**: `layouts = master-stack, grid, monocle` in workspace config (xmonad `|||` pattern)
- **8 tiling layouts**: master-stack, grid, monocle, dishes, spiral, three-col, columns, accordion
- **`teru_set_layout` MCP tool**: agents can switch layouts programmatically (14 MCP tools total)
- **Dishes layout**: horizontal master-stack (master on top, columns below)
- **Accordion layout**: focused pane tall, others compressed to thin strips
- **Spiral layout**: Fibonacci alternating vertical/horizontal splits
- **Three-column layout**: master center, stacks on sides (ThreeColMid)
- **Columns layout**: equal-width vertical columns

### Fixes
- **Keyboard layout switching**: Cyrillic/Ukrainian and multi-layout support via xkb_state_update_key
- **Selection absolute coordinates**: selections stable across scrollback scrolling, work in both grid and scrollback
- **Selection in scrollback overlay**: highlight renders correctly in scrolled-back content
- **Vi mode selection color**: removed duplicate overlay that was painting solid color over text glyphs
- **Mouse drag-to-resize**: works for flat layouts (master-stack/three-col/dishes) with any number of panes
- **Layout switch reactive**: prefix+Space immediately resizes PTYs and redraws (no mouse click needed)
- **Status bar height**: PTY resize accounts for status bar, fixing bottom content cutoff
- **Resize both directions**: H/L for horizontal master, K/J for vertical master (dishes)
- **Auto-select respects config**: addNode/removeNode skip auto-layout when workspace has a layout list
- **Wayland modifier group**: keyboardModifiers callback captures layout group for proper layout switching

### Refactoring
- **Split LayoutEngine.zig** (2,077 lines) into 4 modules: types.zig, layouts.zig, Workspace.zig, facade
- **Extract scrollback helper**: Multiplexer.getScrollbackLineCount() replaces 17+ inline duplicates
- **Remove floating layout**: non-functional stub replaced by dishes

### Removed
- **Floating layout**: removed non-functional cascading window stub

## 0.2.7 (2026-04-06)

### Features
- **Per-workspace layout lists**: configure layout cycling per workspace with `layouts = master-stack, grid, monocle` in `[workspace.N]` config sections. Prefix+Space cycles within the workspace's list (xmonad `|||` pattern)
- **8 tiling layouts**: master-stack, grid, monocle, dishes, spiral, three-col, columns, accordion
- **Spiral layout**: Fibonacci/golden ratio spiral that alternates vertical and horizontal splits
- **Three-column layout**: master pane in center with stacks on left and right sides (ThreeColMid)
- **Columns layout**: equal-width vertical columns
- **Dishes layout**: horizontal master-stack — master on top (full width), stack in columns below
- **Accordion layout**: focused pane gets most height, others compressed to thin strips
- **`teru_set_layout` MCP tool**: agents can switch layouts programmatically
- **Layout list hot-reload**: changing `layouts` in teru.conf applies immediately without restart

### Fixes
- **Resize in three-col/dishes layout**: `resizeActive` now adjusts master_ratio for three_col and dishes
- **Auto-select respects config**: `addNode`/`removeNode` no longer override the layout when a per-workspace layout list is configured
- **Split tree cleared on layout switch**: `cycleLayout`, `toggleZoom`, and `teru_set_layout` now clear the split tree so flat layouts take effect

### Removed
- **Floating layout**: removed non-functional stub (cascading windows with no user interaction)

## 0.2.6 (2026-04-06)

### Features
- **Session persistence (daemon mode)**: `teru --daemon <name>` starts a headless session where PTYs survive terminal close. `teru --session <name>` reattaches in TTY raw mode. `teru --list` shows active sessions. Ctrl+\ detaches.
- **Wire protocol**: 5-byte header (tag:u8 + len:u32) over Unix domain socket for daemon↔client communication. Message types: input, output, resize, detach, grid_sync.
- **Session socket**: `/run/user/{uid}/teru-session-{name}.sock` with permission 0660.

### Architecture
- `src/server/daemon.zig` — daemon event loop with poll() over PTY fds + client socket
- `src/server/protocol.zig` — message framing, encode/decode helpers
- One daemon per session (zmx/abduco pattern) for crash isolation

## 0.2.5 (2026-04-06)

### Features
- **Binary split tree layout**: horizontal and vertical splits with arbitrary nesting, replacing the flat pane list. Keyboard: `prefix + \` (vertical), `prefix + -` (horizontal)
- **Mouse drag-to-resize pane borders**: click and drag any split border to adjust the ratio
- **MCP pane creation with direction/command/cwd**: `teru_create_pane` supports `direction`, `command`, and `cwd` parameters. New panes inherit the active pane's working directory by default
- **Grid resize on pane layout change**: grid dimensions now match pane rect, so apps render at full pane width
- **teru-mcp skill**: `.claude/skills/teru-mcp.md` teaches agents how to use teru's MCP tools

### Fixes
- **Crash on pane creation**: dangling pointers after ArrayList reallocation — all pane VtParser/Grid/Scrollback pointers re-linked after append
- **Pane borders respect status bar**: layout calculation subtracts status bar height
- **JSON unescape in teru_send_input**: `\n`, `\r`, `\t` now sent as actual control characters
- **Ctrl+letter normalization in mux commands**: holding Ctrl after prefix no longer fails (e.g., Ctrl+Space then Ctrl+V = vi mode)
- **Mouse_down tracked during mouse tracking**: fixes tmux pane border drag-to-resize (mode 1002)
- **Selection release skipped during mouse tracking**: prevents selection finalization conflicts with app mouse handling

## 0.2.4 (2026-04-05)

### Features
- **Vi/copy mode**: keyboard-driven scrollback navigation and text selection (prefix + v)
  - hjkl / arrow keys for cursor movement, w/b/e for word motion
  - g/G for top/bottom of scrollback, Ctrl+U/D for half-page, H/M/L for viewport
  - v for character selection, V for line selection, o to swap endpoint
  - y to yank to clipboard, / to search, q or ESC to exit
  - Status bar shows -- VI -- / -- VISUAL -- / -- VISUAL LINE --
  - Vi cursor rendered as inverted block overlay

## 0.2.3 (2026-04-04)

### Features
- **DEC Special Graphics charset (ACS)**: ESC(0 / ESC(B for line-drawing character set — fixes garbled tmux borders

### Fixes
- **Alt+key sends ESC prefix**: Alt+1..9 for tmux windows, Alt+b/f for word movement now work
- **Scroll suppressed in alt screen**: tmux/vim handle scrolling themselves, teru no longer scrolls its own scrollback on top
- **Mouse tracking isolation**: drag events go to app (tmux border resize) instead of starting text selection when mouse tracking is active
- **Auto-scroll during drag selection**: dragging near viewport edges scrolls into scrollback
- **Deduplicated UTF-8 encoding**: Selection.getText uses shared appendUtf8 helper

## 0.2.2 (2026-04-04)

### Features
- **Programmatic box-drawing**: U+2500-U+257F and block elements U+2580-U+259F rendered pixel-perfect edge-to-edge, replacing font glyphs — fixes gaps in separator lines
- **Scrollback preserves colors and attributes**: bg color, bold/dim/italic/inverse encoded in scrollback lines, full UTF-8 (was ASCII-only, fg-only)
- **Scrollback selection**: text selection works in scrollback region, reads from scrollback buffer for rows above viewport

### Fixes
- Removed unconditional dimColor() that dimmed all scrollback text — colors now match active viewport
- Scrollback renderer parses bg color SGR codes and attributes, renders via atlas for non-ASCII

### CI
- Fixed release workflow (removed broken aarch64 cross-compilation)
- Replaced AUR publish action with direct script (KSXGitHub action had bash bug)

## 0.2.1 (2026-04-03)

### Features
- **Live config reload**: inotify watches ~/.config/teru/ directory for teru.conf changes
- **Mouse reporting**: modes 1000/1002/1003/1006 for app mouse support (vim, tmux)

## 0.2.0 (2026-04-03)

### Features
- **Config system**: `[section]` headers, `[workspace.N]` per-workspace config, external theme files
- **30+ config options**: opacity, cursor_blink, cursor_shape, tab_width, scroll_speed, bell, copy_on_select, padding, prefix_timeout_ms, bold_is_bright, term, font_bold/italic/bold_italic, show_status_bar, bar_left/center/right, mouse_hide_when_typing, word_delimiters, dynamic_title, notification_duration_ms
- **Base16 themes**: `theme = miozu` built-in, external files at `~/.config/teru/themes/<name>.conf` with base00-base0F keys
- **Workspace tabs status bar**: shows all active workspaces, layout indicator [M/G/#/F], pane title from OSC, configurable sections
- **Bold/italic font rendering**: separate font files per style (font_bold, font_italic), atlas-per-variant with fallback
- **bold_is_bright**: shift ANSI 0-7 to bright 8-15 when cell is bold
- **Double-click word select**: 300ms detection, configurable word_delimiters
- **Mouse hide when typing**: X11 invisible cursor, Wayland wl_pointer_set_cursor(null)
- **Bracketed paste**: wraps paste with `\e[200~`/`\e[201~` when mode 2004 is active
- **Focus events**: sends `\e[I`/`\e[O` to PTY on window focus change
- **CLI flags**: --config, --theme, --class, improved --help with keybinding reference
- **Window opacity**: `_NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY` (X11), `setAlphaValue` (macOS)
- **Cursor blink**: 530ms timer, resets to solid on keypress
- **Wayland mouse**: full `wl_pointer` listener — click, motion, scroll wheel
- **macOS compilation fix**: replaced `@Type`-based `MsgSendType` with concrete function pointer types (Zig 0.16 compat)
- **Platform parity**: X11, Wayland, macOS share matching API surface

### Performance
- **XCB-SHM zero-copy framebuffer**: ~10x faster X11 rendering vs socket transfer
- **Pixel-smooth scrolling**: sub-cell offset accumulator, configurable scroll_speed
- **Scroll position pinning**: viewport stays in place while output arrives
- **Key repeat debounce removed**: typing at native compositor rate

### Fixes
- Scroll overlay clipped to active pane rect (no bleed across panes or status bar)
- Color-preserving scrollback: SGR colors retained, dimmed to 75%
- Smart scroll exit: modifier keys, F-keys, arrows don't reset scroll position
- PageUp/PageDown work without Shift modifier
- All config fields wired to subsystems (shell, scrollback_lines, term, padding, etc.)
- Code review cleanup: shmat error check, dead code removal, redundant checks

### Features
- Color-preserving scrollback: SGR colors (red, green, etc.) retained in scroll history
- Scrollback capture encodes cell foreground colors as SGR sequences
- SGR parser in scroll overlay handles indexed (256) and RGB colors

### Fixes
- dimColor now 75% brightness (was 50%, too dim on dark themes)

### Features
- Ctrl+Shift+C/V copy/paste keyboard shortcuts
- Status bar notifications with auto-clear (copy feedback, etc.)
- Per-pane independent scrollback

## 0.1.3 (2026-04-01)

### Features
- Configurable prefix key: `prefix_key = ctrl+b` in teru.conf (accepts ctrl+a through ctrl+z, ctrl+space, raw integers)
- Pane zoom: `Ctrl+Space, z` toggles between current layout and monocle, restores on second press
